This is a Tie-In app which is still under development stage. Me(working on Android version) and Thong(working on iOS version)
are working with Josh and Cameron to achieve the following goals:

What is Tie-In?
Tie-In is an academic related smartphone application for San Diego State University.

Target Audience:
-->SDSU students and staff to begin with. Faculty, Professors, and Students will all use this app.
-->If we are able to have it successfully work at SDSU we can then begin to expand it for other campuses in San Diego
 (4 year universities and community colleges).
-->This app has the potential to be used by every college in the nation

Goals achieved till now:
--> Login screens
--> CreateAccountScreen
--> UserDemographic screen
--> Home screen, Swipe-In menu which will contain links to events and postings, Blackboard, News Feed of clubs and organizations, contact information etc.
--> Added Facebook login button so that when people log into the tie-inn app with Facebook they can grant permissions to our app to retrieve their information.

Yet to cover?
-->Links to events and postings.
-->An app that ultimately combines Blackboard, Web portal, SDSU pages (scholarships, events, etc.) and Rohan email page
Clubs, originations, ands Greek posting boards.
-->News feed ( Displaying all campus, clubs, events, organizations information)
-->Professor rating page (similar to “Rate My Professor” but all posts would include users name for honest and legitimate reviews)
-->Ability to find the contact information for every professor and faculty member on campus in an easily accessible way.

Not working:
--> Connectivity to MySQL database that is created using phpMyAdmin
--> Facebook login works first time while the app logins but second time it stops working and gives error : This app has no Android key hashes configured.
